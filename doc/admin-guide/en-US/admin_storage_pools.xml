  <title>Setting up Trusted Storage Pools</title>
  <para>Before you can configure a GlusterFS volume, you must create a trusted storage pool consisting of the storage servers that provides bricks to a volume.  </para>
  <para>A storage pool is a trusted network of storage servers. When you start the first server, the storage pool consists of that server alone. To add additional storage servers to the storage pool, you can use the probe command from a storage server that is already trusted. </para>
  <para><note>
      <para>Do not self-probe the first server/localhost.</para>
    </note></para>
  <para>The GlusterFS service must be running on all storage servers that you want to add to the storage pool. See <xref linkend="chap-Administration_Guide-Start_Stop_Daemon"/>  for more information.</para>
