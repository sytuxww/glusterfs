  <title>Setting up GlusterFS Server Volumes</title>
  <para>A volume is a logical collection of bricks where each brick is an export directory on a server in the trusted storage pool. Most of the gluster management operations are performed on the volume.   </para>
  <para>To create a new volume in your storage environment,  specify the bricks that comprise the volume. After you have created a new volume, you must start it before attempting to mount it. </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Volumes of the following types can be created in your storage environment: </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Distributed - Distributed volumes distributes files throughout the bricks in the volume. You can use distributed volumes where the requirement is to scale storage and the redundancy is either not important or is provided by other hardware/software layers.  For more information, see <xref linkend="sect-Administration_Guide-Setting_Volumes-Distributed"/>     .</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Replicated – Replicated volumes replicates files across bricks in the volume. You can use replicated volumes in environments where high-availability and high-reliability are critical. For more information, see  <xref linkend="sect-Administration_Guide-Setting_Volumes-Replicated"/>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Striped – Striped volumes stripes data across bricks in the volume. For best results, you should use striped volumes only in high concurrency environments accessing very large files. For more information, see <xref linkend="sect-Administration_Guide-Setting_Volumes-Striped"/>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Distributed Striped - Distributed striped volumes stripe data across two or more nodes in the cluster. You should use distributed striped volumes where the requirement is to scale storage and in high concurrency environments accessing very large files is critical.   For more information, see <xref linkend="sect-Administration_Guide-Setting_Volumes-Distributed_Striped"/>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Distributed Replicated - Distributed replicated volumes distributes files across replicated bricks in the volume. You can use distributed replicated volumes in environments where the requirement is to scale storage and high-reliability is critical. Distributed replicated volumes also offer improved read performance in most environments. For more information, see <xref linkend="sect-Administration_Guide-Setting_Volumes-Distributed_Replicated"/>. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Distributed Striped Replicated – Distributed striped replicated volumes distributes striped data across replicated bricks in the cluster. For best results, you should use distributed striped replicated volumes in highly concurrent environments where parallel access of very large files and performance is critical. In this release, configuration of this volume type is supported only for Map Reduce workloads. For more information, see <xref linkend="sect-Administration_Guide-Setting_Volumes-Distributed_Striped_Replicated"/>.
